# Ex1-Tester
Tester for Ex1 (Coding Introduction)

I fixed the tester of Ex1 so it work..
The code and script used to unzip and yet try open from the zip, which worked only if you use zip named Ex1 and without any folder in it.
My gets a path to parent folder and tests the Ex.1 no mather what name it's saved as.
In addition it accept with or without folder inside the ZIP, with or without zip (file might be just in the folder not zipped) etc.
The test takes the first .java file it finds by the following order:
If found in: ZIP -> In child dir -> In parent dir / Not found at all.
